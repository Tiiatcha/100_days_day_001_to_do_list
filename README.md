# 100 days of Code... Day 1 - the Todo list
A To-Do list built on PHP, MySql and Javascript

I have been building the odd app here and there based primarily with PHP and a splattering of JavaScript for a few years now. and decided I was going to do this chalange mainly to get min into better habbits.... well just a habbit would be an accomplishment!

I will start with a simple todo list. The primary goals of which are:
1. Strore List to Database
2. Retrieve List from Database
3. Reorder list (and store this in DB)

Bonus items will be
* Assign Tags
* Sort by Tag
* Assign Items to other people (users)
